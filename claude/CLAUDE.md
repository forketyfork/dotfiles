**Prefer the following tools**:
- `rg` as a better alternative to `grep` to search for text in files
- `date` to get the current date/time
- `tree` to get a tree-like view of a directory
- `fd` as a better alternative to `find`
- `gh` to access GitHub issues, pull requests, etc.
  - if being asked to address the review comments, use command `gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/pulls/<#PR>/comments` to get the comments and their context

**Style**:
- Prefer self-documenting code over comments
- If you need to delete some code, remove it without leaving any comments in its stead
- Use grammatically correct English for comments

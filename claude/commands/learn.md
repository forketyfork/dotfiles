Reflect about this coding session. Based on our interaction and your thought process, please update the project level CLAUDE.md with guidelines, insights and documentation that might help you solve the task easier, more correct and effective next time:

- identify blockages you had during this coding session, cases where something didn't work or cases where you had to
  iterate;
- add important technical findings and learned lessons that may have helped you converge on a solution faster and with
  fewer steps;
- update and fix outdated stuff;
- improve the document with guidelines that you've received during this coding session (part 2);
- avoid duplication of what's already present in the file; restructure the file if needed.

Keep your technical findings at a high level of abstraction to make sure they cover enough ground to be applicable to a variety of different tasks you might encounter in the future.

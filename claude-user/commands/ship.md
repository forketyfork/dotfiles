Please create a branch if needed (if on main/master branch), add all changes in the working directory, commit with a nice commit message explaining the changes, and push.
Include my original prompt into the commit message. Structure the message in
the following way:

```
<short description>

Prompt: <original prompt...>

Solution: <description of your solution...>
```

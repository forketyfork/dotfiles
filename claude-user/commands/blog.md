Please prepare a draft of a blog post for my blog regarding the following topic: $ARGUMENTS

The post should be a markdown file located in `~/dev/github/forketyfork/forketyfork.github.io/jekyll/_posts`. 

It should have the following frontmatter:

```md
---
layout: post
title: "<post title>"
date: <today's date, e.g. 2025-07-31>
tags: <list of tags in square brackets, e.g., [AI, Ollama, Local Models]>
---
```

Style guidelines (IMPORTANT!)
- Write in a style similar to other posts in this directory, use a similar naming pattern.
- Only write an English version of the post, do not look into de and ru subdirectories.
- Use correct English, but do not use em-dash.
